## About

**Astra Launcher** is an experimental universal modding framework for the **Wii U**, designed to run under **Aroma**.

The goal is to go beyond traditional file replacement and provide one unified system for loading different kinds of mods.

Astra Launcher is designed to detect the game being launched through its **Title ID**, find compatible mods on the SD card, and allow the user to choose which ones should be enabled.

> ⚠️ Astra Launcher is currently in early development. Most features described below are planned and may not be implemented yet.

---

## 🌙 Goals

Astra Launcher aims to support:

- 🎨 Texture packs
- 📁 File replacement
- 🎵 Custom music and sounds
- ⚙️ Gameplay patches
- 🧠 Memory/function patches
- 🧩 Multiple mods at the same time
- ⚠️ Mod conflict detection
- 📦 SDCafiine-style mod packs
- 🗺️ Custom levels and maps
- 👤 Custom characters
- 🎮 Game-specific mod APIs
- ➕ Advanced addons that can add new content instead of only replacing existing content

---

## 🎮 How it should work

When a compatible Wii U title starts:

```text
Wii U Menu
     ↓
Game launched
     ↓
🌙 Astra Launcher
     ↓
Title ID detected
     ↓
Compatible mods found
     ↓
Select enabled mods
     ↓
Apply file replacements / patches / addons
     ↓
Start the game
```

If no compatible mod is installed, the game should simply launch normally.

---

## 🧩 Mod Types

### 📁 File Replacement

The simplest type of Astra mod.

Used for things such as:

- textures
- sprites
- music
- sound effects
- UI
- other game files

The goal is to provide functionality similar to **SDCafiine** while integrating it into the Astra mod manager.

Example:

```text
Original game file:

/vol/content/player/texture.dds

        ↓

Astra replacement:

SD:/wiiu/SolarLauncher/games/TITLE_ID/MyMod/content/player/texture.dds
```

---

### ⚙️ Gameplay Patches

Astra will eventually be able to apply modifications to the running game.

Examples:

- changing gameplay values
- changing player limits
- modifying mechanics
- hooking game functions
- changing game behavior
- memory patches
- function replacement

For example:

```text
Original game:

Maximum Players = 2

        ↓

Astra gameplay patch

        ↓

Maximum Players = 4
```

---

### ➕ Addons

The long-term goal of Astra is to support **real additional content**.

Instead of only replacing:

```text
Original Level
      ↓
Modified Level
```

a Astra addon could potentially allow:

```text
Original Levels
      +
New Fan-Made Level
      +
New Boss
      +
New Character
```

Advanced addon support will require **game-specific Astra APIs/adapters**, because every game handles levels, characters, saves and other content differently.

---

## 📂 Planned SD Structure

```text
SD:/wiiu/SolarLauncher/
├── games/
│   └── TITLE_ID/
│       ├── ModName/
│       │   ├── mod.json
│       │   ├── content/
│       │   ├── patches/
│       │   └── addons/
│       │
│       └── AnotherMod/
│           ├── mod.json
│           ├── content/
│           ├── patches/
│           └── addons/
│
├── config/
├── cache/
└── logs/
```

A basic Astra mod could contain:

```text
MyMod/
├── mod.json
├── content/
├── patches/
└── addons/
```

Example `mod.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Example Mod",
  "author": "Example Author",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "titleId": "00050000XXXXXXXX",
  "type": "replacement"
}
```

---

## ☕ SDCafiine Compatibility

One of Astra Launcher's goals is to support existing **SDCafiine-style file replacement packs** whenever possible.

This would allow users to keep using existing Wii U texture and file packs while benefiting from Astra's mod management system.

Astra Launcher is not intended to simply replace SDCafiine, but to build upon the same general idea and extend it toward more advanced types of modding.

Astra could support both structures:

### Astra native mods

```text
SD:/wiiu/SolarLauncher/
└── games/
    └── TITLE_ID/
        └── MyMod/
            ├── mod.json
            └── content/
```

### Existing SDCafiine packs

```text
SD:/wiiu/sdcafiine/
└── TITLE_ID/
    └── MyTexturePack/
        └── content/
```

Astra could detect both automatically.

---

## ⚠️ Mod Conflicts

Astra is planned to detect when multiple mods try to replace the same file.

For example:

```text
HD Texture Pack
└── player/
    └── character.texture

Custom Character
└── player/
    └── character.texture
```

Astra could warn the user:

```text
⚠ MOD CONFLICT DETECTED

2 mods modify:

player/character.texture

Priority:

1. Custom Character
2. HD Texture Pack
```

The mod with the highest priority would be loaded.

This would make it possible to combine multiple mods while reducing unexpected conflicts.

---

## 🪐 Mod Layer System

Astra could treat enabled mods as layers.

For example:

```text
Original Game
     ↓
HD Texture Pack
     ↓
Custom Music Pack
     ↓
Gameplay Mod
     ↓
Custom Character Mod
     ↓
Game starts
```

When multiple mods modify the same resource, Astra would follow the configured priority order.

---

## 🎯 First Advanced Test Project

One of the first advanced projects planned for Astra Launcher is a **3–4 player mod for the Wii U port of Cuphead**.

This project will help test several Astra systems at once:

- additional players
- additional controllers
- gameplay patches
- custom player sprites
- HUD modifications
- file replacement
- game-specific patches

The goal is to expand Cuphead's existing local multiplayer support beyond two players.

Concept:

```text
Player 1 → Cuphead
Player 2 → Mugman
Player 3 → Custom Mugman Variant
Player 4 → Custom Mugman Variant
```

Players 3 and 4 are planned to support custom visual variants based on existing characters.

This project could later serve as an early experiment for a future **Astra Cuphead API** capable of supporting more advanced fan-made content.

Examples could eventually include:

- fan-made levels
- new bosses
- new Run 'n Gun stages
- new playable characters
- custom islands
- new weapons
- new charms
- additional music
- additional visual content

---

## 🌍 Astra Game APIs

Some types of content cannot be loaded universally because every game handles its internal systems differently.

Astra therefore plans to support optional **game-specific APIs/adapters**.

For example:

```text
🌙 Astra Launcher
│
├── Astra Cuphead API
├── Astra Mario Kart 8 API
├── Astra Minecraft API
└── Other Game Adapters
```

These adapters could expose systems that mod creators can use without having to manually reverse-engineer every part of a game.

Conceptually, a game API could support actions such as:

```text
RegisterLevel()
RegisterCharacter()
RegisterMap()
RegisterBoss()
RegisterMusic()
RegisterWeapon()
RegisterItem()
```

The exact available functionality would depend on each supported game.

---

## 🗺️ Example: Cuphead Fan-Made Island

A future Cuphead addon could theoretically look like:

```text
FanmadeIsland/
├── addon.json
├── island.json
│
├── levels/
│   ├── boss01/
│   ├── boss02/
│   └── runngun01/
│
├── map/
│   └── island5/
│
├── sprites/
├── music/
└── sounds/
```

For example, `island.json` could describe the additional content:

```json
{
  "name": "Inkwell Island 5",
  "levels": [
    {
      "name": "Clockwork Chaos",
      "type": "boss",
      "path": "levels/boss01"
    },
    {
      "name": "Toon Town Trouble",
      "type": "run_and_gun",
      "path": "levels/runngun01"
    }
  ]
}
```

Astra would detect the addon and use the **Astra Cuphead API** to integrate the additional content into the game.

## ❤️ Credits

### 🌙 Project

**Astra Launcher**

Created and led by **[Eitan1414/Pixel Plugin Studios]**

Concept, project direction, testing, design and original idea by the Astra Launcher project creator.

---

### 🤖 Development Assistance

Special thanks to **OpenAI's GPT-5.6 Sol** for development assistance, technical research, brainstorming, architecture design and support throughout the creation of this project.

The project was originally named **Solar Launcher** in tribute to **GPT-5.6 Sol**, whose help contributed to this project and other Wii U development projects. Its yellow sun logo reflected that name.

As the project continues with **GPT-6 Astra**, it is now called **Astra Launcher**, extending that tribute to this new chapter. The original tribute to Sol remains part of the project's history.

The logo has evolved with the name: a **pale mauve moon** now replaces the yellow sun, while the familiar **white lightning-shaped L** is kept, enlarged and centered within the moon. **Astra** appears in glacier blue beside **Launcher** in white. This new visual identity connects the project's beginnings with its next chapter.

> Astra Launcher is an independent community project and is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI.
(yep I'm using IA and what I need some moral and development help anyway I know that all of you already do a lot of crazy stuff with IA so don't blame me)
